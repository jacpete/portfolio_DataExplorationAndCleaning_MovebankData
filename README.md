# portfolio_DataExplorationAndCleaning_MovebankData
This is my first entry into a collection of repos I will be creating to make up my data science portfolio.
They will mostly contain projects I have worked on in the past that highlight my abilities programming in R, data management and cleaning, and conducting spatial and statistical analysis.


This repo contains a slightly modified version of the final project from my graduate level environmental informatics class (ABE 651) I took in the Spring of 2019 at Purdue University.
For this class we had to find a data set online and use it to practice skills in data management, visualization, and quality checking.
While all the analysis is included in the Rmarkdown document, the knitted pdf is in the format of a report; describing the data and methods used and then summarizing the results.

Included Files:
* Envionmental_Informatics_Project.Rmd - The main file that contains all the code and analysis needed to output the pdf file.
* Envionmental_Informatics_Project.pdf - The pdf rendering of the Rmd document.
* dataReferences.bib - Bibtex file containing the referenced literature.
* ecosphere-doi.csl - XML document that controls the formatting for the works cited (Ecosphere journal). Modified to include DOI links.
* data - Folder contains the original data downloaded from the MoveBank website. See below for citations.
